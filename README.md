# Charactereoid: Chrome Canvas Recorder for AI Chats and Visualizers

A Chrome extension that records canvas animations of AI chat interactions with visualizers and audio.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

Charactereoid is a busy, capable tool built for streamers, researchers, and curious users who want to capture the dynamic visuals that appear during AI chat sessions. The extension focuses on recording real-time canvas animations produced by AI chat visualizers and the accompanying audio track. It leverages browser APIs to grab the canvas stream, combine it with audio, and export a synchronized video file. The result is a clean, shareable record of how an AI chat scene plays out, including the artful visualization that many AI chat UIs display.

Charactereoid isn‚Äôt just a recorder. It‚Äôs a small fusion of drawing, sound, and scripting that helps you preserve moments from AI conversations. It is designed to be robust in the face of different chat UIs, canvas-based renderers, and audio sources. It ships with sensible defaults and an extendable structure so you can adapt it to your own AI chat setup.

This project sits at the intersection of AI, visual in-browser media, and web animation. It is particularly useful for developers who want to study how AI models render their responses, creators who want to produce showpieces of AI interaction, and educators who want to illustrate dynamic AI behavior to students. The extension is built to be approachable, with clear setup steps, sensible defaults, and a pathway to customization.

Charactereoid runs as a Chrome extension. It watches the web page for canvas elements that render AI visualizations, captures those canvases, records the frames, and streams the result into a video file with synchronized audio. The end product is a portable media file you can upload to a video site, share with teammates, or embed in a presentation.

The name Charactereoid evokes motion, character, and visualization. It reflects the project‚Äôs goal: to give you a reliable way to turn fleeting AI canvas animations into a lasting artifact. The extension keeps the process simple, but it‚Äôs built on solid web technologies so you can trust the result.

## üéØ What Charactereoid Lets You Do

- Record real-time canvas animations produced by AI chat visualizers embedded in web pages.
- Capture audio alongside canvas frames to produce a synchronized video.
- Produce shareable media of AI chat sessions, including the visual flair that accompanies many Chat UI experiments.
- Work with a range of AI chat implementations, including those that render canvas-based visuals and dynamic overlays.
- Export the captured session as a video file for easy distribution or archiving.
- Use a straightforward setup to get started quickly with minimal friction.

Charactereoid does not require you to modify the AI chat page. It relies on chrome extension capabilities to hook into the page‚Äôs rendering when you grant permission. The extension remains lightweight and safe by design, focusing on the media capture pipeline and avoiding unnecessary page modifications.

## üß∞ Features at a Glance

- Canvas-aware recording: The extension detects and captures the main visual canvas that represents the AI‚Äôs visualization.
- Audio capture: It includes the system or browser audio track so you get a faithful soundtrack to the visuals.
- Simple export workflow: One-click export produces a video file with synchronized visuals and audio.
- Cross-page compatibility: Designed to work with various AI chat UI implementations that use canvas for visuals.
- Local processing: All recording happens in the browser without cloud dependencies, preserving privacy and control.
- Configurable frame rate: Choose an appropriate frame rate to balance quality and file size.
- Export formats: Video formats suitable for common platforms, with room for future format support.
- Extensible architecture: The codebase invites contributors to add new visualizers or audio processing modules.

In practice, you get a compact capture tool that sits quietly in your browser, ready to record when you encounter an AI chat moment you want to capture. The resulting video can be shared, demonstrated, or studied later.

## üß© How It Works

Charactereoid combines several browser capabilities to deliver a smooth recording experience:

- Canvas capture: It locates the target canvas in the active tab and captures its frames as a media stream.
- Audio track: It taps into the audio stream from the tab or system source to align with the canvas frames.
- MediaRecorder: It uses the MediaRecorder API to encode the combined video and audio streams into a file.
- Synchronization: The extension ensures the canvas frames and audio stay in lockstep to create coherent playback.
- Export: It assembles the final media file and prompts the user to save it locally.

Behind the scenes, the extension maintains a small orchestration layer that coordinates between content scripts, the background process, and the extension‚Äôs UI. This separation helps keep things stable as AI visualizers come and go on the page.

The recording pipeline is designed to be resilient. Even if a page changes while recording, the extension attempts to re-sync with the active canvas and audio sources. If it detects an unavailable source, it gracefully continues with whatever frames were captured up to that point.

## üß≠ User Guide

This guide walks you through installation, setup, and day-to-day use. The goal is clarity and reliability so you can start recording high-quality AI chat visuals quickly.

- Prerequisites
  - A Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.) that supports MediaRecorder and canvas capture.
  - Administrative rights to install extensions or side-load unpacked extensions during testing.
  - A page with AI chat visuals rendered on a canvas and an audio source you want to accompany the visuals.

- Installation (one-time)
  - Open the browser‚Äôs extensions page.
  - Enable Developer Mode.
  - Load the unpacked extension from the source code directory.
  - Pin Charactereoid to the toolbar for quick access.

- How to start a session
  - Open a chat page that renders visualizations on the canvas.
  - Click the Charactereoid icon to begin a recording session.
  - The extension searches for a primary canvas element on the page. If found, it starts capturing frames.
  - If an audio source is available, the extension includes it in the capture.
  - When you are ready to finish, click Stop to end the session.

- Exporting and sharing
  - After stopping, the extension prompts you to save the video file.
